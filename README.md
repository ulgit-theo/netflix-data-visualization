Netflix Data Visualization with Power BI Welcome to my Netflix data visualization project! ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

About the Project This project explores over 8000 movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The data includes details such as cast, directors, ratings, release years, duration, and more.

Objectives and Task Ideas Understand content availability in different countries. Identify similar content by matching textual features. Analyze the network of actors and directors for intriguing insights. Examine whether Netflix has focused more on TV shows than movies in recent years.
